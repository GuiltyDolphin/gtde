* Getting Things Done in Emacs (=gtde.el=)

This project provides a suite of tools for Getting Things Done
in Emacs, with support for Org mode (and hopefully other
formats in the future).

** Development

The project is structured as follows:

- =gtde.el= :: main package file, this should just =require=
  from other files
- =gtde-oo.el= :: class interface, provides most of the
  back-end functionality
- =gtde-transient.el= :: provides wrappers around the
  =transient= package
- =gtde-ui.el= :: provides definitions for user interface
  interaction


To test the project, first run =make install= (if you haven't
already), then run =make test=.
